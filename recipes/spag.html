  <p>This bacon carbonara is a super rich, classic "bacon and egg" spaghetti dish that's great to serve for company. This recipe also makes an unusual brunch offering.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
    <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Step 1</h5>

  <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</p>

  <h5>Step 4</h5>

  <p>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</p>
