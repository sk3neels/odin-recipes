  </p>

  <h4>How to Store New York-Style Cheesecake</h4>

  <p>Store the cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to four days. Don’t let it sit at room temperature for more than two hours.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>18 graham crackers, crushed</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>

  <h5>Step 1</h5>

  <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.</p>

  <h5>Step 2</h5>

  <p>Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the springform pan.</p>

  <h5>Step 3</h5>

  <p>Whisk sour cream, flour, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; set aside.</p>

  <h5>Step 4</h5>

  <p>Stir cream cheese and sugar together with a wooden spoon in a separate bowl until evenly incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes; add milk and whisk until just combined. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Stir in lemon zest, orange zest, and sour cream mixture; whisk until just incorporated. Pour mixture into prepared springform pan.</p>

  <h5>Step 5</h5>

  <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have nicely puffed and the surface of the cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour.</p>

  <h5>Step 6</h5> 

  <p>When the cheesecake is done, turn off the oven and let it cool in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. This prevents any cracks from forming on the top of the cheesecake.</p>
